Instructions are as follows

1. Clone this repo into the Documents folder on the pi
2. Setup the start.py script to run on boot by typing
a) "sudo nano /etc/rc.local"
b) Putting the line "python /home/pi/Documents/MHP_BL_Testing/start.py" before the line "exit 0"
3. Setup the log.py script to run every minute by typing
a) "crontab -e"
b) Putting the line "* * * * * python /home/pi/Documents/MHP_BL_Testing/log.py" at the end of the file

Note make sure that the bl_log.txt file is created using "nano bl_log.txt" instead of "sudo nano bl_log.txt" otherwise the python
scripts will not have permission to edit the file.
